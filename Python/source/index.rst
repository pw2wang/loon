Welcome to diver's documentation!
=================================
This is introduction for the diver package 

This project depens on the following packages:

- `numpy`_
- `pandas`_ (version 0.23.4 or later)
- `shapely`_ (interface to `GEOS`_)

Description:
--------------
loon is an extendible interactive data visualization system designed for exploratory visualization.

Though primarily for exploratory data analysis, it can also be used to develop new interactive analysis and teaching tools. Some sense of the breadth of application and possible extensions can be seen in the various vignettes, demos, and examples in the documentation.

Some sense of the use of loon can be had from the articles, especially the introduction, available :ref:`Introduction`.

Here are some sample code::

    print('hello World')
    >>> hello World
